;;! \brief  Unsigned Integer (32-bit) Division
;;! \author Vishal Coelho  
;;! \date   03/25/2016 
;;
;; DESCRIPTION:
;;
;;   This function performs a 32-bit unsigned division (truncated)
;;
;; FUNCTIONS:
;;
;; void FID_ui32byui32(uint32_t *p_num_rem, uint32_t *p_den_quo)
;;  
;; ASSUMPTIONS:
;;
;; ALGORITHM:
;;
;;  The algorithm used is a slow division method (Restoring division)
;;  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Restoring_division
;;
;;  Let N be the dividend, D the divisor, T a temporary variable and P 
;;  the partial remainder of each iteration, i the bit index and loop iterator
;;    R = 0                   -- start with a remainder of 0
;; loop i = 31:-1:0
;;    T = (R << 1) + N(i) - D -- shift up remainder, tack on MSb of numerator
;;                            -- subtract divisor
;;    if(T >= 0)              -- if the difference is positive 
;;      R = T & 0xFFFFFFFF    ---- remainder = T        
;;      N = N << 1 + 1        ---- shift numerator up and add 1 (quotient)
;;    else                    -- else                  
;;      R = (R << 1) + N(31)  ---- shift up remainder, tack on MSb of numerator
;;      N = N << 1            ---- shift up numerator 
;;    end
;; endloop                    -- after 32 such iterations N has the quotient
;;                            -- and R the remainder
